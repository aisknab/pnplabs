# PNP Labs public status package

This checkout is the public website, current inventory-derived report bundle, checksum manifest, reviewer documentation, minimal fixture harness, and smoke-test package for the PNP project.

## Current status

**Formal reconstruction is in progress. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`.**

The exact status mirror is [`public/pnp-status.json`](public/pnp-status.json), copied verbatim from `aisknab/pnp/public/pnp-status.json`. Its current boundary is:

The pinned `leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0` toolchain compiles the explicit `PNP` library root. [`public/pnp-theorem-inventory.json`](public/pnp-theorem-inventory.json) is the exact public mirror of the compiled environment inventory: **26,540** exported public declarations across **240** modules, including **13,884** theorem-kind declarations and **7,159** assumption-free theorem-kind declarations. It excludes **14,935** private compiler auxiliaries and records **four** project axioms.

The inventory-derived publication map binds 2,487 reviewed theorem candidates to kernel-type fingerprints and binds the complete Lean source/configuration closure. Ninety-nine scoped milestones are earned. They cover the concrete machine model, Cook-Levin semantics and the bounded formula-builder prefix, the typed locked-NAND threshold, strict codecs, fixed parsers and emitters, concrete polynomial reductions, verified residual-gain chains, the global semantic stopping specification, terminal carriers and support construction through computed BN2 square legitimacy, the computed terminal BCEL anchor nucleus with fail-closed proper-cut classification, the terminal saturation-positivity firewall, candidate-derived terminal saturation cost balance, finite interface-exposure routing, exact origin/kernel/obligation closure routing, the finite terminal positive-saturation composition, the fixed ten-coordinate residual RankWF, and the report-facing concrete locked-NAND threshold theorem.

The newest milestone publishes `PNP.Main.locked_nand_threshold` at the exact type `ReducesTo CNFSAT EncodedLockedNANDThreshold`. Its witness is the composed finite parser, compiler, and emitter pipeline, so the all-bitstring correctness, runtime, output-size, malformed-input, and raw-refinement results are part of the concrete boundary. Its compiled closure uses only `Quot.sound` and `propext`, with no project axiom.

This is a polynomial many-one reduction, not a polynomial-time decider for the target. It does not map the current finite terminal routes into the manuscript's complete global outcome system, establish route completeness or Package E, remove the finite composition's explicit positive premise, prove manuscript-wide SaturatePositive or BCELReady, establish `ZeroSlack`, PCCMin exactness or polynomial runtime, prove SAT NP-hardness or CNF-SAT NP-completeness, place CNF-SAT in P, activate the legacy string-handle bridge, or prove `P = NP`. Two global milestones remain unearned: global ZeroSlack, PCCMin and polynomial runtime; and the concrete standard P-versus-NP target/root.

The abstract string-handle `PNP.PEqualsNP` bridge is explicitly publication-ineligible. `PNP.Main.ConcretePEqualsNP` is present as an inactive axiom-free definition for the finite charged-pipeline model, while `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` remains absent. The concrete publication gate is a strict conjunction of concrete semantics, target/root fingerprints, axiom closure and source closure; null expected fingerprints are unconfigured and never match null. All theorem-establishment and theorem-emission fields derive only from that gate.

The active blockers are the five entries in `remainingFormalObligations` and `remainingBlockers`, covering concrete SAT, residual-band minimisation, ZeroSlack, polynomial runtime and certificate bounds, and the root theorem plus axiom audit.

Legacy JavaScript checker acceptance verifies assertion-bearing records under implemented predicates. It is historical assertion-checker evidence only and is not a formal proof of the named mathematical propositions. Earlier activated coordinates, verifier-run records, digest matrices, and badge summaries are preserved only as historical audit records. Their intake is frozen and they are not current theorem-emission surfaces.

External review remains welcome as audit and bug-finding evidence, but it is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.

These commands build the pinned Lean root, regenerate/check the compiled inventory and publication model, verify the report, and run the focused axiom audits. Their success does not fill the two unearned global milestones or establish the target theorem.

The public status page is [`status.html`](status.html).

## Milestone updates

[`updates.html`](updates.html) publishes one plain-language update for every formal
milestone earned after the 39-milestone tracking baseline. Each entry has a
collapsed technical section generated from the canonical milestone record rather
than independently maintained prose. [`updates.xml`](updates.xml) is the Atom/RSS
subscription feed; following it requires no account or email address.

The editorial source is [`content/milestone-updates.json`](content/milestone-updates.json).
Its baseline set and entries must exactly cover the currently earned milestones,
so a formal-publication sync fails closed if it earns a milestone without adding
an update. Each entry binds to the exact merged core commit, tree, status, and
publication coordinate. It deliberately does not repeat the containing site
commit or deployment ID: those would be circular before the entry is committed.
The release seal and deployment-provenance record bind those identities
independently.

## Public payloads

- [`public/pnp-index.json`](public/pnp-index.json) is the payload index and current conservative boundary summary.
- [`public/pnp-status.json`](public/pnp-status.json) is the exact authoritative status mirror.
- [`public/pnp-theorem-inventory.json`](public/pnp-theorem-inventory.json) is the exact compiled Lean declaration inventory mirror, hash-bound by the status payload.
- [`public/pnp-one-command-upload.json`](public/pnp-one-command-upload.json) records that the former activated-run upload path is frozen.
- [`public/pnp-verification-runs.json`](public/pnp-verification-runs.json) preserves the old run registry as a frozen historical snapshot.
- [`public/pnp-verifier-run-comparison-matrix.json`](public/pnp-verifier-run-comparison-matrix.json) and [`public/pnp-verifier-run-matrix-summary.json`](public/pnp-verifier-run-matrix-summary.json) are historical comparison records, not a current green status badge.
- [`public/pnp-public-review.json`](public/pnp-public-review.json), [`public/pnp-theorem-emission-gate.json`](public/pnp-theorem-emission-gate.json), and [`public/pnp-external-review-status.json`](public/pnp-external-review-status.json) are older audit payloads and do not override the current formal-reconstruction status.

## Trust boundaries

- A SHA-256 match verifies artefact identity only. It does not verify theorem correctness.
- The local minimal fixtures demonstrate named educational invariants only. They are not proof evidence.
- The historical JavaScript checker stack evaluates assertion-bearing records under its implemented predicates. It does not formalise or prove those asserted mathematical propositions.
- The bundled canonical PDF and TeX are the current eighty-two-page inventory-derived formal status report. They report `CNFSAT ∈ NP`, raw-machine compilation, exact Cook-Levin semantic equivalence, the bounded formula-building prefix, global locked-NAND baseline output conditions, strict encoding and concrete reductions, the verified residual and terminal-support chain through computed BN2 square legitimacy, the canonical positive BCEL anchor nucleus, the zero-or-positive whole-support projection-defect classifier, candidate-derived terminal saturation cost balance, finite interface-exposure routing, origin/kernel/obligation closure routing, the finite terminal positive-saturation composition, and the fixed residual RankWF. They explicitly disclose that the observer and projection remain inputs, the proof-bearing problem and positive initial full-slack premise remain explicit, no current route has been mapped into the complete global outcome system or proved to decrease the rank, and the result is not manuscript-wide SaturatePositive, Package E, BCELReady, global gain completeness, the manuscript's `ZeroSlack` construction, PCCMin exactness and polynomial runtime, the rest of the Cook-Levin formula body, SAT NP-hardness or CNF-SAT NP-completeness transport, the abstract threshold discharge, CNF-SAT in P, or P = NP.
- A partial Lean bridge or a successful build of supporting modules is not the target theorem. The root theorem must exist, build, and pass an axiom audit without project-specific assumptions.
- The historical 57-page claim manuscript remains at tag `final-pnp-proof-report-hardened-7072f8d`, commit `7072f8d0bda6d44d240f9bb3fad624fd357e1278`, with provenance in `archive/legacy-v0/ARCHIVE.json`; it is never current authority.

```

## Website development

There is no build step for the static site. Run it locally with:

```bash
npm start
```

The pages load `assets/styles.min.css`. If CSS changes, regenerate it from `assets/styles.css` with:

```bash
npx clean-css-cli -o assets/styles.min.css assets/styles.css
```

The first viewport also uses an inline critical CSS block in each HTML page. If that block changes, update the matching `style-src` SHA-256 hash in `_headers` and `public-surface.mjs`.

## Deployment boundary

Public hosting should serve only the static pages, `assets/`, `downloads/`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `security.txt`, `.well-known/security.txt`, `CNAME`, and public status material. Do not present this website checkout as a substitute for the source repository or its Lean source.

The atomic home-server procedure, runtime deployment provenance, Nginx boundary, rollback behavior,
and manual post-deployment audit are documented in
[`docs/deployment_verification.md`](docs/deployment_verification.md). Deployment coordinates and
hashes establish file identity only; they do not establish theorem correctness.
