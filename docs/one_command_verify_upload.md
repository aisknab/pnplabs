# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout c912b110f14386d335d58bb89b1bb9bb643bffb4
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks the distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The current earned scope includes the concrete `CNFSAT ∈ NP` theorem, literal compilers, typed locked-NAND reductions, the residual and terminal chains, the finite Packet selector and HB layers, all reflected Packet classifier fields, checked budget/HB and semantic/HN bindings, the Packet no-lower ledger, supplied-family HResolve routing, the terminal-derived support and budget resolvers, their same-candidate finite Packet composition, the finite BCEL/Packet results, the concrete report-facing compatibility links, typed PCCPack reflection, the proof-bearing PCCMin total-oracle loop, and proof-bearing normalization/oracle composition. The newest row composes a supplied proof-bearing total normalizer with the supplied proof-bearing total oracle, lifts later gains through non-increasing semantic normalization, and transports exact-minimum and ZeroSlack endpoints into the checked terminating loop. Both stages remain supplied and the regression fixtures use exhaustive reference minimisation, so this does not construct executable PCCMin, prove unconditional ZeroSlack or encoded-size polynomial runtime, supply a target decider or SAT NP-hardness transport, or create the root theorem. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
