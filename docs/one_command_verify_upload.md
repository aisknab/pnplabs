# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout 7dc26600f55762bf7a65b3fc6512a76aba23d9d0
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks the distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The current earned scope includes the concrete `CNFSAT ∈ NP` theorem, literal compilers, typed locked-NAND reductions, the residual and terminal chains, the finite Packet selector and HB layers, all reflected Packet classifier fields, checked budget/HB and semantic/HN bindings, the Packet no-lower ledger, supplied-family HResolve routing, the terminal-derived support and budget resolvers, their same-candidate finite Packet composition, the finite BCEL/Packet results, the concrete report-facing locked-NAND compatibility link, and the concrete residual-band compatibility bridge. The newest row gives the public residual-band endpoint fail-closed encoded exact-minimum semantics and replaces its caller-supplied edge with a compiled identity reduction, removing `PNP.ResidualBandExactMinimization` from project-specific proof authority. It does not supply polynomial residual minimisation, residual-band promise bounds, a target decider, SAT NP-hardness transport, unconditional ZeroSlack, exact polynomial PCCMin, or the root theorem. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; two project-specific axioms and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
