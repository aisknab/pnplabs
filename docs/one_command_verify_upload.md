# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout 9a81dd86dc92260f3cdc56b6a463b78c651cfad6
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The newest row, **All-route physical classifier terminal join**, has this scope: For every concrete verifier problem, every coordinate in its complete post-header schedule and arbitrary protected workspace, M226 injectively embeds M220's complete 711-rule classifier and adds one total nine-symbol, tape-preserving redirect from its unique Finish/reject terminal to the same continuation-ready accepting state reached by all body coordinates. The resulting collision-free 720-rule machine takes zero additional steps on body routes and exactly one redirect step on Finish, with exact work, six-for-one compiled execution, one-step-short nonhalting and one source-input-size polynomial bound. All 34 public declarations are axiom-audited: 22 have empty closure, three use only propext, and nine use only propext and Quot.sound, with no project axiom or Classical.choice. This milestone normalizes only the complete physical classifier's terminal control flow. It does not synthesize, stage or dispatch a body-token request, connect successive schedule configurations, implement one repeated raw-machine builder loop, prove builder FunctionProgram.RawRefinement, or package the Cook-Levin PolynomialReduction. It does not establish CNFSAT NP-hardness or NP-completeness transport or CNFSAT in P, close a fixed checkpoint or global gate, create the eligible root theorem, or prove P = NP. No fixed weighted checkpoint changes, so the risk-weighted estimate remains 35% while formal artefact coverage becomes 202 of 204. All five global gates remain open. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
