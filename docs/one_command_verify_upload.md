# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout 76bd4815a3294b3642db76f1737ffd3e0e31266e
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The newest row, **All-coordinate Cook-Levin selected-token launch**, has this scope: For every concrete verifier tableau problem and every post-header schedule coordinate, the canonical schedule alone derives padding, the exact body token, or the unique Finish token without a supplied route or token. M214's physical classifier contract is retained, every populated entry runs the existing fixed 59-rule appender to the exact next emitted prefix, exact work and compiled traces time out one step short, and the combined staged work fits one verifier-derived source-size polynomial. All 30 public declarations are axiom-audited with only the approved Lean-standard closure and no project axiom or Classical.choice. M215 derives each canonical post-header padding, body-token, or Finish entry and launches the existing fixed token appender for populated entries through executable Lean orchestration. The selection handoff is not yet a literal raw tape rewrite. It does not iterate the complete token schedule, construct the complete raw formula builder or its FunctionProgram.RawRefinement, or package the concrete Cook-Levin PolynomialReduction. It does not establish CNFSAT NP-hardness or NP-completeness transport or CNFSAT in P, close a fixed checkpoint or global gate, create the eligible root theorem, or prove P = NP. No fixed weighted checkpoint changes, so the risk-weighted estimate remains 35% while formal artefact coverage becomes 191 of 193. All five global gates remain open. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
