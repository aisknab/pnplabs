# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout f5d42870ee50c903ebcff8a71da05a74256be59d
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The newest row, **Literal Cook-Levin post-header raw tape bridge**, has this scope: For every concrete verifier tableau problem, arbitrary exterior workspace, and in-range coordinate, one fixed collision-free 351-rule bridge consumes the exact M209 equality or greater-than terminal tape, derives zero or the exact positive shifted remainder, copies the positive problem width, and reaches a shielded M211 input. Exact bridge and divider traces preserve the complete exterior, recover the exact quotient and remainder, compile at six raw steps per work step, time out one step short, and fit one verifier-derived source-size polynomial. All 78 public declarations are axiom-audited with only the approved Lean-standard closure and no project axiom or Classical.choice. M213 closes the literal M209-to-M211 physical tape handoff only. It does not select, emit, or append a Cook-Levin body or Finish token, iterate the complete token schedule, complete the raw formula builder or its FunctionProgram.RawRefinement, or package the concrete Cook-Levin PolynomialReduction. It does not establish CNFSAT NP-hardness or NP-completeness transport or CNFSAT in P, close a fixed checkpoint or global gate, create the eligible root theorem, or prove P = NP. No fixed weighted checkpoint changes, so the risk-weighted estimate remains 35% while formal artefact coverage becomes 189 of 191. All five global gates remain open. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
