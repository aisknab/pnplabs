# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout 32cccbf7af9761dffac7d5139e3f10a87b98358c
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The newest row, **Complete semantic Cook-Levin schedule iteration**, has this scope: For every concrete verifier tableau problem, structural recursion consumes every verifier-derived post-header schedule opportunity without a supplied coordinate, token, route, trace, schedule, or precomputed formula. Every bounded run equals the canonical emitted prefix, the complete run equals encodeCNFTokens of the generated formula, every coordinate retains M215's exact classifier/appender evidence for arbitrary workspace, and the aggregate staged compiled work fits one source-size polynomial. All 12 public declarations are axiom-audited with only the approved Lean-standard closure and no project axiom or Classical.choice. M216 composes M215's proof-carrying per-coordinate stages through executable Lean recursion. It is not one literal raw-machine loop and does not prove a physical tape-to-tape handoff between successive stages, construct the complete raw formula builder or its FunctionProgram.RawRefinement, or package the concrete Cook-Levin PolynomialReduction. It does not establish CNFSAT NP-hardness or NP-completeness transport or CNFSAT in P, close a fixed checkpoint or global gate, create the eligible root theorem, or prove P = NP. No fixed weighted checkpoint changes, so the risk-weighted estimate remains 35% while formal artefact coverage becomes 192 of 194. All five global gates remain open. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
