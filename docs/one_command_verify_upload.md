# Historical activated-run upload flow is frozen

The former one-command upload and issue-ingest path is no longer active. It submitted `PNPActivatedVerificationRunRecord0` records against a superseded theorem-emission status.

The current source status is `formal-reconstruction-in-progress`. The repository does not currently establish `P = NP`, so accepting new records under the old activated schema would misstate the theorem boundary.

## Current commands

Use the source repository to inspect formal reconstruction:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisknab/pnp.git
cd pnp
git checkout 8a9c372156eea1b0f8bc47bd0c7b139b3a2f17b3
npm ci
npm run formal:inventory:check
npm run validate
npm run report:check
```

`formal:inventory:check` owns the Lean build and compiled inventory. `validate` then checks distinct verifier, regression, axiom, status, public-surface, and archive contracts without another standalone `lake build`; `report:check` verifies the derived publication. PNPLabs imports those exact artifacts and does not rerun Lean. The newest row, **All-body staged-request physical dispatch**, has this scope: For every concrete verifier problem and every coordinate in its complete clause-token body rectangle, M225 runs the complete 711-rule classifier while preserving an explicitly staged canonical optional-token request, relays that request through one fixed 14-rule scanner, and executes M223's reflected 64-rule dispatcher. One collision-free 807-rule composition covers populated and padding coordinates and reaches each exact next canonical emitted prefix, with exact work, six-for-one compiled execution, one-step-short nonhalting and one source-input-size polynomial bound. All 80 public declarations are axiom-audited: 32 have empty closure, nine use only propext, and 39 use only propext and Quot.sound, with no project axiom or Classical.choice. This milestone stages each canonical body or padding request explicitly on protected tape. It does not synthesize that request from raw classifier state, include the unique Finish route in the same machine, connect successive schedule configurations, implement one repeated raw-machine builder loop, prove builder FunctionProgram.RawRefinement, or package the Cook-Levin PolynomialReduction. It does not establish CNFSAT NP-hardness or NP-completeness transport or CNFSAT in P, close a fixed checkpoint or global gate, create the eligible root theorem, or prove P = NP. No fixed weighted checkpoint changes, so the risk-weighted estimate remains 35% while formal artefact coverage becomes 201 of 203. All five global gates remain open. `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` is absent; no project-specific axioms remain and five blockers remain.

## Freeze controls

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pnp-verification-run.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/pnp-verification-run-issue-ingest.yml` no longer listens to issue events and has read-only permissions.
- `public/pnp-verification-runs.json` has `intakeFrozen = true`.
- The import tool rejects with `ImportRun.IntakeFrozen` before adding a record.
- The old comparison matrix and summary are labelled historical.
- The summary exposes `currentStatusBadge = false`, a neutral tone, and no current green pass state.

## Historical record boundary

The old prompt, schema, coordinates, and one site-CI seed record are preserved only so previous public behaviour can be audited. Their assertion-bearing content is not current theorem-status evidence or mathematical proof.

External review remains optional audit evidence and is not a mathematical premise or release blocker.
