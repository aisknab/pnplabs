# Formal-reconstruction wording guard

This file supersedes its former activated-status wording. It remains at the same path so old links resolve, but its rules now enforce the current conservative boundary.

## Current required wording

Public surfaces must make these facts unambiguous:

```text
status = "formal-reconstruction-in-progress"
mathematicalTheoremEstablished = false
publicTheoremEmissionAllowed = false
publicTheoremStatement = null
finalTheoremReady = false
rootLeanTheoremPresent = false
rootLeanTheoremBuilt = false
rootLeanTheoremAxiomAuditPassed = false
projectSpecificAxiomsRemaining = true
leanConcreteCNFSATMembershipFormalized = true
leanConcretePipelineCanonicalPairCompilationFormalized = true
leanConcretePipelineExternalInputSizePolynomialFormalized = true
leanConcretePipelineMalformedInputBehaviorFormalized = true
leanConcretePipelineSequentialCompilationFormalized = true
leanConcretePipelineRawRefinementFormalized = true
leanConcreteFunctionProgramRecursiveCompilationFormalized = true
leanConcreteDecisionProgramRecursiveCompilationFormalized = true
leanConcretePolynomialTimeDeciderRawCompilationFormalized = true
standardComplexityModelFormalized = true
leanConcreteCNFSATInPFormalized = false
leanConcreteCNFNPCompletenessFormalized = false
```

The short public statement is:

> Formal reconstruction is in progress. The repository does not currently establish P = NP.

The pinned `leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0` toolchain compiles the explicit `PNP` library root and exports a canonical theorem inventory. Forty-one narrowly scoped milestones are earned from reviewed theorem types, approved axiom closures, and the complete Lean-source digest. They include universal concrete CNF-SAT verifier correctness, exact accept/reject behavior, no timeout at a polynomial fuel bound, and `PNP.Concrete.FinalUniversalDesign.cnfSATInNP : InNP CNFSAT`. They also include literal raw-machine compilation, exact Cook-Levin semantics through `encodedFormula_mem_CNFSAT_iff_language`, the external encoded-size bound `encodedFormula_size_le`, an answer-independent rectangular formula schedule, and a direct formula cursor. Fixed finite machines reach all three complete fixed clauses, traverse every remaining second- and third-clause padding coordinate without emitting a token, emit the separator beginning clause four, and then emit the first negative literal `F T F` in clause four. `BuilderFourthClauseFirstLiteralPrefix.machine` composes the complete fourth-clause separator prefix with the reused 357-rule `F T F` appender/cursor suffix through one outer total nine-symbol bridge. Every raw bitstring emits the complete first negative literal on variable one in clause four, preserves `encodedFormula.take (2 * (FormulaWidth + 31))`, and advances the retained coordinate to `FormulaVariableSlotBound + 1 + 3 * FormulaTokensPerClause + 4`, whose direct next token is `F`. Its literal table has `3666` plus ten inherited/generated unary-evaluator rule counts; its external compiled bound is `BuilderFourthClauseSeparatorStep.rawTimeBound + 1422 + 72 * inputLength + 36 * FormulaWidth + 36 * cursorWord.length`. The combined 115-declaration audit covers all 97 new public declarations, 16 reviewed reused suffix interfaces, and two cursor dead-state facts using only the approved Lean-standard closure, with no project or choice axiom. This emits exactly one complete fixed literal in clause four. It observes but does not emit the following `F`, does not complete clause four, emit the remaining formula body, implement a general dynamic formula cursor, supply the complete raw builder or builder `FunctionProgram.RawRefinement`, or package a polynomial reduction. The results do not prove CNF-SAT NP-completeness, CNF-SAT in P, or `P = NP`. Global locked-NAND construction, premise instantiation, candidate-universe completeness, ZeroSlack, PCCMin, the residual-band minimizer, polynomiality, and `PNP.Main.p_eq_np` remain unfinished. Four project-specific axioms and six formal blockers remain. The concrete target is present but inactive, the publication gate is false, and the abstract string-handle `PNP.PEqualsNP` bridge is publication-ineligible.

## Checker wording

Use this boundary when describing the old JavaScript stack:

> Legacy JavaScript checker acceptance verifies assertion-bearing records under implemented predicates. It is historical assertion-checker evidence only and is not a formal proof of the named mathematical propositions.

Do not describe a passing legacy record, digest match, matrix cell, or site CI run as proof of the assertions stored in that record.

## Historical surfaces

The following are preserved only for auditability:

- `PNP-ACTIVATED-STATUS-2026-07-05-01` and related activation coordinates;
- the activated verifier-run registry and record schema;
- digest comparison matrices and summaries;
- the 56-page manuscript at source tag `final-pnp-proof-report-hardened-7072f8d`.

Every such surface must be labelled historical or superseded. The current canonical report is instead the forty-page inventory-derived non-claiming report. The activated-run intake is frozen. No green matrix badge is a current status signal.

## External review

External review is optional audit and bug-finding evidence. It is not a mathematical premise or release blocker. The formal result must stand or fail on its definitions, proofs, build, and axiom audit.

## Prohibited current wording

Current public surfaces must not say that theorem emission is enabled, that the final theorem is ready, that blockers are empty, or that the old checker stack emits an established `P = NP` theorem. Historical quotations or archived record fields must be explicitly marked as superseded data.
